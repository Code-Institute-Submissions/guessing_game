# Wildlife Quiz
Wildflife Quiz is an online guessing game written in Python using the Flask framework.
 
## UX

When creating this project I was greatly influenced by Clarissa Peterson's [Learning Responsive Web Design](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920029199.do). Some methods (e.g. start with the design for the smallest screen size, use "rem" units, minification) were directly taken from her book. I wanted to make the project "mobile first" and responsive. It was designed with simplicity in mind, meant to be easy to navigate and give user simple information to process. It's a casual entertainment for casual gamers hence its trivial look. I've tried to keep it close to modern trends in apps design. My goal was to create a user-friendly web application and I wanted to make it obvious, how to use available functionalities.

### Users Stories:

To make things easier, I've created User Stories. Here are some examples:
- As a website user, I want to able sign in. 
- As a player, I want to check if I picked correct letter.
- As a player, I want to check my score.
- As a player, I want to compare my score with other players.
- As a player, I want help when I'm stuck.

### Wireframes

Examples of wireframes I've created for this project:
-[Early idea](https://github.com/chookmook29/guessing_game/blob/master/wireframes/mockup1.png)
-[Early tablet screen layout](https://github.com/chookmook29/guessing_game/blob/master/wireframes/mockup2.png)
-[More compact mobile first layout](https://github.com/chookmook29/guessing_game/blob/master/wireframes/mockup3.png)
-[Just before project's development started](https://github.com/chookmook29/guessing_game/blob/master/wireframes/mockup4.png)
Some concepts of the design and some features changed over the development process.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- I would like to make onmouseover event in JavaScript trigger loss of player's remaining "attempts" by one each time, however this would require 

## Technologies Used
- HTML and CSS
    - project uses **HTML** and **CSS** to build webpages.
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
    - The project uses some **Bootstrap** elements for webpages' layout.
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
    - Back-end was written in **Python** .
    - **vnev** library was used in development of the project.
    - **random** module was used with dictionaries.
- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)
    - The project was built **flask** microframework due to its simplicity.
    - **flask.session** was used to store all variables values. 
- [Jinja2](https://jinja.pocoo.org/)
    - Used for creating templates.
- [unit-test](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)
    - Used for automated testing.
- [JSON](https://www.json.org/)
    - **JSON** was used to keep data in separate file.
- [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)
    - Used to store large static media files.
- [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/)
    - Before development started, **Balsamiq** was used for wireframes.

## Testing
### Automated tests before deployment:

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
